# Knights-Adventure-Csharp
The goal of this platformer game is to survive against the three knights with a sense of collecting coins only to die when the player knight reaches the finish line believing that the player is claiming a prize. The player knight can move using the left and right arrow keys or the left A and right D keys to move the player knight.
